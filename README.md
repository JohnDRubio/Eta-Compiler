This messy repository is the result of many long hours implementing a compiler for a toy language known as Eta. This project was developed while taking [Cornell's CS4120: Introduction to Compilers course](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4120/2023sp/). 

Special thanks to Arjun Shah and Zack Hatzis for helping to build our first (kind of) optimizing compiler.
